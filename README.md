# Music Lamp

- dataset explorer + algorithm sandbox
- small set of artist from Aotearoa
- fields to use: genre, language, region, ethnicity (if available), number of followers/listeners
- UI - sort, filter, run a basic algorithm (ranking system or cluster genres)

JSON dataset, what is k-means?
Super basic react app

why? hands on algorithm logic exp and how does data influence visibility
is value computed or inferred?

example of computed value:
value assigned though quantitative mathmatical processes

- a song ranked higher because it has 100k plays
- an artist is recommended more often because they are on 10+ playlists
- albums get RIAA Certification because of a spike in engagement with 24 hours (viral)

Computed value is explicit and visible in platform logic

example of inferred value:
more abstract — platforms (or their users) assume something is valuable because of context or patterns

- an artist with lots of followers is assumed to be good, even if followers were bought or passive
- a track is added to a popular playlist, the platform assumes it’s relevant or trending
- an artist is played by a listener who also likes Beyoncé, the platform infers that others who like Beyoncé might like this artist too

Inference is relational — value is deduced from associations, correlations, or user behavior patterns

What counts as valuable and how does that shape culture by:

- compressing cultural richness into data points
- metrics (plays, likes) over others (community impact, political meaning)
- human judgment obscured behind maths? What is undiscovered?

What to find:

- what kinds of value can’t be captured by algorithms?
- are the metrics that determine visibility fair?
- how might indie artists from diverse backgrounds be misrepresented or flattened by algorithmic inference?
